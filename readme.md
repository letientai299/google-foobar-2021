# My adventure on solving Google Foobar

Right now, just some take aways for you:

- I solve them without looking at any implementation (I did try to understand
  the ideas of level 5, but then fail and decide to learn Group Theory and solve
  it myself instead).

- I don't expect to get an interview from Google, just feel cool to accomplish
  somethings I couldn't have done 6 years ago.

Some lesson learns for myself:

- This adventure would finish much faster if I'm not so lazy to go with a proper
  brute force solution for level 4.2 and level 5.

You can watch [the
videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcuGpHQxfbJWt_1CbsL8w-knx7ZP9arDk) of
me solving first 7 problems within first 4 hours since entering Foobar. The
first few minutes of each videos should show you full problem statements (and I
guess that'll be the only interesting bits for you). By the way, they're just
the usual Easy or Medium Leetcode problems with wordy statements and invisible
test cases. If you're comfortable with Medium levels in Leetcode, just ignore
them.

The last 2 problems are interesting.

## Bringing a gun to a guard fight

- [Problem statements and ideas can be found here.](https://peter-ak.github.io/2020/05/10/Brining_a_gun_to_a_guard_fight.html)
- [My solution](./java/src/main/java/com/foobar/gun/Gun.java)

This one is not so hard, requires a bit of Geometric Calculus, which is
something I'm capable of. But I spend more than 10h thinking and solve an
entirely other problem by mistake: [The Laser gun and mirrored
room](https://amininima.wordpress.com/2013/05/27/the-laser-gun/). That problems
is about _how many bodyguards do we, as the Commander, need to block all
beams?_. Foobar problem is about _how many vector can we shoot the Commander
when our beam can travel a limited distance?_. Damn!

I recorded the first 1.5 hour on this one, but then throw away the video since I
know I'll need more time than that, and you definitely don't like to watch me
struggling more than 30m anyway.

## Disorderly Escape

This is something I want like to write about, because I spend 22 days can get it
over my head, learned a new subject (Group Theory) to solve it and use tons of
papers to tests various ideas.

[Here's the code](./java/src/main/java/com/foobar/disorderlyEscape/DisorderLyEscape.java).

More on it later. I'll need to enjoy my life a bit first.

To the people at Google who use it for level 5, thank you, I can't wait for the
nest time I need Group Theory in my life!
